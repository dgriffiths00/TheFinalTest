git add MyFile.txt
git status

mkdir Info
touch InfoFile1
touch InfoFile2 

git config user.name Duncan_INFO

I used vim to edit MyFile.txt with course name and code at the top.
I used git status to check the status of the repository.
I learned that I am very confused as to what is meant by reflect on what I've learned.
